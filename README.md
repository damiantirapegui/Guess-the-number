This a project that I made together with my mentor from the UDEMY corse.
It's a simple game where you can guess the number.
You can type the number that you want to guess and press check.
You will receive a message if the number is to low or to high untill you get the correct number.

You also have a highscore section which will save your latest highscore. In that way you can compete with yourself or with some other friends. To keep the highscore it's important to press the again button and not refresh the page otherwise you will loose the highscore and it will start over.
